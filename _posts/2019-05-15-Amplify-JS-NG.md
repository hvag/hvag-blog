title: AWS Amplify, JavaScript, Angular
---

We have an existing Angular application.  Let's attempt to integrate AWS solutions via Amplify to utilize systems
such as Cognito for user authentication and DynamoDB for data persistence.

Let's use this AWS [Amplify JavaScript](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/js/angular) page as a reference.

## Install Amplify

````
$ npm install --save aws-amplify
$ npm install --save aws-amplify-angular
````

## Configure Amplify

````
$ amplify configure
````

## Angular 6+ Support

Resolve Amplify Angular 6+ Issue as per [AWS](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/js/angular)
1. Modify polyfills.ts  
````
(window as any).global = window;
````

2. Modify index.html
````
<script>
    if (global === undefined) {
        var global = window
    }
</script>
````

3. Modify tsconfig.app.json
````
"compilerOptions": {
    "types" : ["node"]
}
````

## Setup

````
$ amplify init

Note: It is recommended to run this command from the root of your app directory

##  Importing the Amplify Angular Module and the Amplify Provider

Import the configuration file and load it in main.ts:
````
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';
import amplify from './aws-exports';
Amplify.configure(amplify);
````

In the app module src/app/app.module.ts import the Amplify Module and Service:
````
import { AmplifyAngularModule, AmplifyService } from 'aws-amplify-angular';

@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [
    ...
    AmplifyAngularModule
  ],
  ...
  providers: [
    ...
    AmplifyService
  ]
  ...
});
````

## Components

Amplify provides UI components that can be used in our view templates.

Try `<amplify-authenticator></amplify-authenticator>`

## Styles

Add the following to your styles.css file to use the default styles: `@import '~aws-amplify-angular/Theme.css';`
